In this traditional Japanese dice game, two dice are rolled in a bamboo
cup by the dealer sitting on the floor. The player must guess if the
dice total to an even (cho) or odd (han) number.

**New rule for this assignment: if the total of the dice is 2 or 7,
you receive a 10 mon bonus added to your purse.**
